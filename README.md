# Cacophony
An app to change your ringtone everyday to a one of a few random ringtones that you've designated.

Sometimes it's hard to choose just one ringtone, while other times you don't want to. Instead, choose several.
Cacophony will randomly select a ringtone from a list of ringtones you choose and set it as your default ringtone everyday. Have fun with your ringtones again. 

Cacophony uses the RingtoneManager class in order to retrieve ringtones, and stores the ones youâ€™ve selected in an SQLite database. Then, when you press the start button it sets an alarm that wakes up a receiver to change your ringtone to a random one from the database. 

Got any ideas to make things easier? Let me know!
