# Cacophony
An app to change your ringtone everyday to a one of a few random ringtones that you've designated.

Sometimes it's hard to choose just one ringtone, while other times you don't want to. Instead, choose several.
Cacophony will randomly select a ringtone from a list of ringtones you choose and set it as your default ringtone everyday. Have fun with your ringtones again. 

Got any ideas to make things easier? Let me know!
